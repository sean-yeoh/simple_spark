# SimpleSpark

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leadmachineapp/simple_spark.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leadmachineapp/simple_spark) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simple_spark.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simple_spark)

## Update from SparkPost

Posted in the SparkPost Announcements channel on 17th May 2016

> Due to incredible support and contributions from the community, we will be discontinuing support of the official SparkPost ruby client library as of May 17, 2016.

As SparkPost have now stopped development on their own gem, and have recommended this one as being a better alternative, bumping version to 1.0.0 - the code has been running in production for a while now and seems stable and near feature complete.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_spark'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install simple_spark
```

## Usage

### Why?

The official gem was somewhat lacking in functionality, though with the demise of Mandrill it seems SparkPost decided to restart development on it, they have now abandoned that as of 17th May 2016

As we would have to write wrappers around all the functions we would need for our app to use SparkPost anyway, it seemed much easier to write the wrapper as a gem and allow others to use it too.

### Status

Breaking change: initialising the client is now done with a hash instead of with ordered parameters, as there were getting to be too many after supporting Subaccounts and user specified headers

## Endpoints

### Creating a Client

First you need to ensure you are requiring the library

```ruby
require 'simple_spark'
```

The simplest version of the client is to just provide your [API key from SparkPost](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/credentials)

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key')
```

You can also use ENV vars to configure the key, setting ENV['SPARKPOST_API_KEY'] will allow you to just use

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new
```

You can also override the other options if you need to in advanced scenarios, the full signature is (api_key, api_host, base_path, debug), i.e.

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key', api_host: 'https://api.sparkpost.com',  base_path: '/api/v1/', debug: false, subaccount_id: 'my_subaccount')
```

#### Debug

Setting debug to true will cause [Excon](https://github.com/excon/excon) to output full debug information to the log.

This will default to true if you are running under Rails and are in a development environment, otherwise it will default to false (setting other values to nil will cause them to use their defaults)

You can also pass a Logger into the client options to have SimpleSpark log there. By default Rails.logger will be used when runnign under Rails, and STDOUT will be used otherwise

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key', debug: true, logger: Rails.logger)
```

#### Subaccounts

By setting subaccount_id on your client you are telling Simple Spark to use that subaccount for all calls made on this instance of the client.

Not all Sparkpost calls support the Subaccount feature, and their API will throw an unauthorized error if you use a subaccount_id on an unsupported call. Depending on your code this may mean you need to instantiate two instances of the Simple Spark client in your code, one for subaccount calls, and one for other calls. This is a less than ideal solution, but due to the rapid pace of Sparkpost development on their API this is the option that causes least dependency up Simple Spark to be updated as their API is.

#### Headers

Should you have any need to override the headers that are sent by default, then you can specify headers as an option. The headers specified here will override any of the generated headers that the library creates. In normal operation there should be no reason to use this option, but it is provided for convenience and to allow for Sparkpost updating their API in any unexpected way.

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key', headers: { 'NewSparkpostHeader' => 'hello'})
```

### Exceptions

SimpleSpark wraps all the common errors from the SparkPost API

If the API takes too long to respond (times out in Excon) a GatewayTimeoutExceeded will be raised

Status 400 raises Exceptions::BadRequest

Status 404 raises Exceptions::NotFound

Status 422 raises Exceptions::UnprocessableEntity

Status 420/429 raises Exceptions::ThrottleLimitExceeded

Other response status codes raise Exceptions::UnprocessableEntity

In some cases it is possible to send too fast for the API (apparently) to handle , in this case the SparkPost API returns a 504 status with an empty body. This is raised by SimpleSpark as Exceptions::GatewayTimeoutExceeded

### Account

#### Retrieve account information

```ruby
simple_spark.account.retrieve
```

The argument can be specified in a comma separated list. The only valid value is currently usage.

```ruby
simple_spark.account.retrieve("usage")
```

  metadata: {user_type: 'students'},
  substitution_data: { sender: 'Big Store Team' },
  recipients:  [
    { address: { email: 'yourcustomer@theirdomain.com', name: 'Your Customer' },
      tags: ['greeting', 'sales'],
      metadata: { place: 'Earth' }, substitution_data: { address: '123 Their Road' } }

    reply_to: 'Sales <sales@yourdomain.com>',
    headers: { 'X-Customer-CampaignID' => 'christmas_campaign' },
    text: 'Hi from {{sender}} ... this is a test, and here is your address {{address}}',
    html: '<p>Hi from {{sender}}</p><p>This is a test</p>'
  }
  # Or to use a template, change the content key to be:
  # content: { template_id: 'first-template-id' }
}

simple_spark.transmissions.create(properties)

To send attachments, they need to be Base64 encoded

```ruby
require 'base64'

    attachments: [{ name: "attachment.txt", type: "text/plain", data: attachment }]
  }
}

# load your file contents first, then use Base64 to encode them
encoded_attachment = Base64.encode64('My file contents')
